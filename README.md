# halffull_theme 0.6
Minimal theme with a bunch of neat extras such as fitvids.js for responsive embeds and featherlight.js for popping images in a nice overlay.
Currently supports primary author cards, small post nav, a bunch of headings and so on.

This theme uses Georgia as a websafe font and loads any plugins, such as jQuery, locally.

Please note that this is a work in progress. As it runs under MIT lisence, feel free to do stuff with it. Shoot me an E-Mail if you did so.
